# CodeItForward

An app for the Bicycle Trek to help participants train. The app maps the user's location, and when the start button is pressed, the stopwatch measures how long you have travelled, as well as tracking the distance and average speed. 

Mockups are made for what we hope to be the final finished product. 

A prototype with invision was also made as well.
